    </p>
    <p>Welcome to my narrative visualization on electricity. I have implemented it as an interactive web page, using my knowledge of visual communication and narrative structure, along with my skills of D3 programming in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>&#128161; Electricity is a key necessity of the modern-world. Many would find it difficult to imagine a world without electricity. I have created this narrative visualization in an attempt to convey important data with regard to electricity utilization.
        on a global scale.</p>
    <p>My narrative visualization follows the "interactive slideshow" narrative visualization structure. User exploration is allowed at some of the steps of the story. Hover effects, tooltips, variable variations, affordances, etc. are included to better
        engage and facilitate user interactions and interpretation. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px"> &#9889; Scene 2 : Scatter plot of the distribution of electricity production from oil, gas and coal sources as a percentage of total vs Carbon Dioxide emissions per capita in metric tons</p>
